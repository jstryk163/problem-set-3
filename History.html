    <h1>First Demo and Self Titled Album</h1>
    <p>Slipknot was formed in 1995 by members Shawn Crahan, Joey Jordison, and Paul Grey. The three of them meet one other from being in local bands in the Des Moines Iowa local metal scene. After the band was created it struggled to have a consistent lineup and after many changes settled on the 9 member Lineup that was present on their first four studio albums. In december of 1995 the band began working and recording their first demo. They had no studio given budget so they had no other option but to self finance the making of the demo. The process of making the first demo was very rough with many of the original members leaving and needing to be replaced. The demo was finally finished and titled Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat and was released on October 31, 1996.The demo gained Slipknot somewhat of a fanbase but didn't get the band very much popularity. After receiving a $500,000, 7 album record deal from Roadrunner Records the band entered the studio to record their first studio album. Now with a lineup that would last for the next four albums, the band released their self-titled album on June 29, 1999 through Roadrunner Records. The album helped to gain Slipknot a larger fanbase and served as the catalyst to their fame. Their self-titled album was certified platinum in early 2000.

    <h2>Iowa and Vol.3:(The Subliminal Verses)</h2>
    <p>The recording process for the much anticipated second release from Slipknot began in early 2001. The recording process for the second album was very difficult due to arising conflicts in the band caused by their extensive touring and recording schedules. Their second album titled Iowa was released on August 28,2001. This album took Slipknot's music to a much darker place and is still considered to this day their darkest album ever. After touring in support of the album the band went on a hiatus due to conflicts within the band. This would only serve as the first of many hiatuses the band would take. During the first Hiatus the members all focused on various solo projects. During this time no one knew for sure what the future of Slipknot had in store or even if there was a future. eventually Slipknot proved there was still a future and released their second DvD titled Disasterpieces on November 22, 2002. After the Dvd release the band began the recording process for their third studio album. On May 24,2004 the band released their third album titled Vol.3:(The Subliminal Verses). The band went on to tour in support of this album through 2004 and 2005. During touring for their third album the band also released their first live album titled 9.0:Live on November 1,2005. at the end of 2005 the band would go on their second hiatus where the members again worked on solo and side projects just like with the first hiatus.

    <h3>All Hope is Gone, .5:The Grey Chapters, and Present</h3>
    <p>The band returned from their second hiatus and began the recording process for their fourth studio album in late 2007. The album,titled All hope is Gone, was released on August 20, 2008 while the band was on the All Hope is Gone tour. Touring in support of the album went on between 2008 and 2009. During this period of time the band celebrated the 10th anniversary of their first album. To celebrate this the band released a special edition of the record on September 9, 2009. Touring for All hope is gone came to an end on October 31, 2009 and the band entered their third hiatus.Except this time the band would not be returning with their full lineup at the end of the hiatus. On May 24, 2010 founding member and current bassist Paul Grey was found dead in a hotel room in Urbandale, Iowa. His death was ruled an accidental overdose of morphine and the synthetic morphine substitute know as fentanyl. The day after Paul Grey's passing the remaining members of Slipknot held a live press conference where they appeared unmasked for the first time in public. The band also released a fourth Dvd titled (sic)ness which served as a tribute to their lost band member. The band continued touring between 2010 and 2013 until they entered the studio in late 2013 to begin the process of recording their fifth studio album. On December 12, 2013 drummer Joey Jordison and the band parted ways leaving Shawn Crahan as the only remaining original member. The name for the next album was revealed on August 24, 2014. The album titled .5:The Grey Chapters was released October 21, 2014 worldwide. Since the release of their fifth album slipknot have continued to do various tours throughout the years. They found replacements for Paul grey and Joey Jordison with new bassist Alessandro Venturella and drummer Jay Weinberg. The band has also started teasing the release of their 6th studio album giving and estimated 2019 release date. Various members of the band have stated that the new album will go back to Iowa levels of heavy and darkness. Besides this no other details have been provided regarding the album.
