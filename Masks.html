    <h1>Reasons For Wearing Masks</h1>
    <p>The idea for wearing masks started with a clown mask that Shawn Crahan had been given as a gift. He would wear it during shows and eventually became known for his clown mask which later lead to his nickname Clown. Eventually it was decided that, along with wearing matching jumpsuits, each member of the band would wear their own unique mask while they performed. Members of the band have stated that wearing the masks were a way to fell unconscious to what they did outside of music and feel more connected to their songs. The matching jumpsuits are meant to be the badns response to commercialism in the music industry. Some people have attacked the idea of wearing masks while performing saying that it is only a sales gimmick. The band has responded to these claims by saying the masks are used to take focus off of the members and put it more on the music as well. Some of the members have said they consider the masks a blessing because they helped to keep their personal lives a secret and make them unrecognizable in public.</p>

    <h2>Evolution and Variation of The Masks</h2>
      <p>Most of the time the band releases a new album their jumpsuits and masks change. The masks never change completely they are only updated while keeping the same general theme. This whole process is meant to represent growth as a band and as individuals. On occasion the band worn masks other than their signature ones. During live performances in 2004 and 2005, and in the music video for their song Vermilion the band wears what they call life masks which are masks made from casts of their own faces. The band has also dawned what they call Purgatory Masks during photo shoots leading up to the release of their 4th album All Hope Is Gone. In the music video for their song Psychosocial the Purgatory Masks can be seen burning in various shoots of the video.</p>
